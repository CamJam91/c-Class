analysis:
I need to take in data from a file and manioulate it in multiple 
ways, including displaying it, searching it, sorting in it

**Remember**
    Keep funcions void
    have functions do only one thing
    validate input: user and file
    use do while loop for menu




bubble sort

int select
minimum = start of array
for start of array to end of array -1
    select = minimum;
    for start of array to end
        if select > select + count
            swap
        end if
    end for
    minimum = select + 1
end for
