initialize a vector that holds list of 5 groups of numbers
	2d vector? or just put numbers in order
allow user to enter 5 digits tp match against said vector
	cin a vector.
perform a linear searchthrough the list of player numbers
	use for and == ?


pseudocode: 
initialize 2d vector with 10 rows of 5 numbers
create a dynamic vector to hold user vector
prompt and cin 5 numbers for user vector

linear search function:
	for each number in set vector
		for each number in user vector
			if current number != column number
			break
