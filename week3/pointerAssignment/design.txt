analysis:
I need to create a program that takes in int values that represent rent prices from std in and stores them in an array

a menu will be the first option to pop up. Use a do while (!exit) loop
	call this menu with getMenuItem function store value in userChoice
a. enter rent amount
	call enterRents
b. sort amount ascending
	selection sort, call selectionSort function
c. display amounts
	displayRents function
d display memory locaiton
	call displayMemoryLocations function, use reference operator

**Remember**
keep functions void and pass arguments that need affected by reference
keep functions to only one thing
Show two decimal places with money and use a $ sign
use pointers to display rent prices

Design 

variables: userOption, int rent vector
call menu function
	menu function calls various functions
enter rents
	for loop: cin to each sub in rent array use push for vector fill
display rents
	validate if rent array has been filled 
	for loop displays rent prices, use pointers not an array
display memory locations
	for loop to show locations in memory of each item in the array
selection sort
	use seleciton sort
